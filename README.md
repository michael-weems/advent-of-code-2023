# Advent of Code 2023 Solution Programs

Using Advent of Code 2023, I am beginning to learn the C Programming Language. I have done some light work in C++ before (though I never got beyond beginner level), but never really delved into straight up C.

## Day 2

This one took me a while. It's been so long since I've had to think about string manipulation at such a low level. TypeScript has spoiled me with `.includes` and such helper functions. I'm getting my _c-legs_ back under me.... I'll stop.

## Day 1

Just want to say that when I finished both solutions they:
- compiled on the first try
- were correct the first try
