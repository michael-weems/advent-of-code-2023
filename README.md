# Advent of Code 2023 Solution Programs

Using Advent of Code 2023, I am beginning to learn the C Programming Language. I have done some light work in C++ before (though I never got beyond beginner level), but never really delved into straight up C.

## Day 4

Much simpler than day 3, spent way less time on this one. Feels pretty good to be getting just a little better at C.

## Day 3

Have to come back to this one - the finer details of converting strings to numbers (ints and longs) is flying over my head. Plus I am pretty tired from the weekend's activities. I got my solution working for the example data provided, but not for the actual puzzle input.

## Day 2

This one took me a while. It's been so long since I've had to think about string manipulation at such a low level. TypeScript has spoiled me with `.includes` and such helper functions. I'm getting my _c-legs_ back under me.... I'll stop.

## Day 1

Just want to say that when I finished both solutions they:
- compiled on the first try
- were correct the first try
